            <em>The Networking of Wireless Information Systems (NetWIS) laboratory</em> led by Dr. Wenye Wang, is focused broadly on in-depth understanding, algorithm and protocol design in mobile wireless networks. Our vision is that by developing new models, measuring experimental results, and understanding basic properties of wireless networks in different circumstances, it is possible to design algorithms, protocols, and architectures that enable a wireless network to have robust architecture and topology and high performance for diversified applications and large-scale distributed, intelligent systems.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our lab members include undergraduate students who gain their experience in research and prepare for their graduate study, and graduate students who aim to make novel contributions to the wireless networking area. Currently, we are focused on issues like mobile clouds, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and wireless in the Smart Grid from the perspective of network resilience and performance in the presence of failures and abnormality.
